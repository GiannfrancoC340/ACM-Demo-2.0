# Airplane Communications Mapping Project - Build Sprint 3

This project was created by Giannfranco Crovetto.

Valid for Engineering Design 2 - Fall 2025. From October 6 2025 - December 2nd 2025

## Overview

Our group project - Airplane Communications Mapping - is a system that captures, organizes, and analyzes real-time air traffic control 
(ATC) communications using software-defined radios (SDRs). It pairs live audio with real-time aircraft tracking and transcribes the 
conversations using speech-to-text tools. The system also uses stress detection algorithms to flag when a pilot may be under 
emotional strain. This information is presented through a web-based dashboard designed for aviation analysts, students, and enthusiasts 
to review live and past flight communications more easily and effectively. 

This is Build Sprint 3, the final build sprint before the final deadline. This counts for all progress made for the project from the first in-class demo, which was on October 6 2025 until the final deadline of December 2 2025. What sets this sprint apart from the previous 2 sprints is this is the longest one, and it will finalize our project, ensure the project has proper styling and updated functionalities to conform to our specifications. 
As a recap, this is the schedule of the build sprints:
- [x] **Build Sprint 1:** August 16 2025 - September 14 2025
* Accounts for picking up work since Spring 2025 and adds an audio section within FlightInfo.jsx, modal popup for individual flights, and a new and improved home + login + signup pages.

- [x] **Build Sprint 2:** September 14 2025 - October 6 2025
* Accounts for everything since BS1/Firebase migration until the first demo. Essentially this is the work done starting with Firebase migration up to the first demo.
* There is Firebase database integration, a working audio player with audio detection, enhanced map interface, backend API server to handle audio requests, password requirements component, settings button, and updated project styles.

- [x] **Build Sprint 3:** October 6 2025 - December 2 2025
* Accounts for everything since BS2/first demo until the final deadline.
